# iOS Adapted Sample App

The iOS Adapted sample app provides app creators with a working example of how to correctly implement the AdAdapted Multiplatform SDK. This app includes examples for utilizing our ad zones, keyword intercept, and tracking functionality.

Official documentation for integrating the SDK libraries can be found at [https://docs.adadapted.com](https://docs.adadapted.com)

### Installing

Simply clone the repository and load it up into Xcode. The app is supplied already with a test API key and ad zones that are used for a suite of test ads and keywords to interact with.
